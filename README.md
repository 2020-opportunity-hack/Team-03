## Daily-Bowl

Founded in 2016, Daily Bowl rescues excess/blemished produce and rapidly redistribute to local non-profits that serve the hungry members of our community. They have recovered and distributed close to 2 million pounds of food within Alameda County.

### Requirements Being Addressed
- Leveraging the existing Airtable database
- Tracking food produce information by allowing the donor to report the food produce at hand.
- Allowing receiving agencies to check the food donation currently available and giving them the option to choose their required food produce. 
- Generating a report from the data used for grant writing as well as by the donor for tax reporting.
